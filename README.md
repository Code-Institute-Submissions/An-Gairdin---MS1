## UX
The site design aims to provide a simple and inviting space, encouraging further interaction with the project either online or in person.
Navigation should be simple and clearly outline the projects main areas.

### Target audience
The primary audience for the website is local to the area (within 100 km) and many users are middle-aged and older. For this reason, the design aims to keep the UI simple and uncluttered with a clear navigation directly from the landing page to each of the three content pages.

There is a simple contact form that allows a user to leave a comment or to subscribe to a mailing list.

Icons allow users to quickly access the organization's social media pages (facebook only at present).

### User Stories
* As a visitor familiar with the project, I want to be able to easily get in touch with a comment or question.
* As a new visitor unfamiliar with the project I want to see a visually appealing introduction to the aims and activites undertaken and be able to easily join a mailing list or otherwise get in touch.
* As a local food enthusiast, I want to see information about the garden produce and see where this is sold locally.
* As a like-minded educator, I want to see some background information on the project and then easily get in touch with collaboration ideas using a contact form.
* As an older user or a user less-accustomed to online interation, I want to see an inviting and easy to navigate space that makes me feel at ease and is in line with my experience of the physical space.

* As a site-owner, I want to have an interenet presence that employs a look and feel in line with our aims, practices and goals. The site should mirror the atmosphere we endeavour to achieve in the physical location. 
* As a site-owner, I want site visitors to easily be able to get in touch with a question or comment, or to ask to be added to the mailing list.
* As a site-owner, I want any contact initiated on the website to go directly to my mail inbox. (nice to have, not a requirement for MS-1).

### Wireframe Mockups
Wireframe mockups are designed mobile-first. 
In initial designs, the landing/home page used a hamburger button in the top right as access to the site navigation. However, I have reconsidered this in light of the expected user/audience (in general an older demographic and perhaps less familiar with the conventions of internet navigation on mobile devices) and have instead chosen to implement individual and clearly visible buttons on the home page. In the future, as the site grows or pages are added, this approach may need to be expanded or superseded by a tidier option such as the hamburger button.

### Color Palette
The color palette used in the site aims to mirror the changing colours of the seasons in a garden and to be at the same time warm, vibrant and inviting. Ideas in relation to colour have been gleaned from general reading. Two useful resources have been [elementor](https://elementor.com/blog/color-theory-web-design/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwreT8BRDTARIsAJLI0KKeRi1NNrRWesVXyhOmyfNpwLFH8CCWWnFQ6Ael53UB6eYECiUufkAaAmKeEALw_wcB) and [coolors] (https://coolors.co/f94144-f3722c-f8961e-f9c74f-90be6d-43aa8b-577590).
As an initial guide, I will be using the palette described in the [draft color scheme](assets/color/draft-color-scheme.pdf).

### Features

**navigation bar** 
The site has a navigation bar integrated into the header (logo left and nav right). This is consistent across all pages of the site and therefore easily learnable for users. It is also a very familiar pattern internet-wide and should present little or no difficulties for users.
On the landing page, the navigation options are also presented in the main body of the page.
**logo** 
The project logo (draft) is presented in the header on al pages.
**footer** 
Each page has a standard footer with copyright info and social media links. In relaity, this project only has a presence on facebook only. For the purposes of the MS1 project, I shall also include dummy links to several other sovial media sites (youtube, instagram, twitter).
**copyright information** 
Copyright information is consistently dispolayed in the page footer (left).
**social media icons**  
In relaity, this project only has a presence on facebook only. For the purposes of the MS1 project, I shall also include dummy links to several other sovial media sites (youtube, instagram, twitter).
**hero image** 
There are 2 plans for a hero image. Time shall decide which gets implemented:
Plan A: Include a carousel or video of several images that change behind the static text and nav buttone on the landing page.
Plan B: Have a standard static hero image on the landing page.

In general, images will play a big role in the site and all pages shall have visual content.
