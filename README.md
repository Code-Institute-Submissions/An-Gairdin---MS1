# An Gáirdín

## UX
The site design aims to provide a simple and inviting space, encouraging further interaction with the project either online or in person.
Navigation should be simple and clearly outline the projects main areas.

### Target audience
The primary audience for the website is local to the area (within 100 km) and many users are middle-aged and older. For this reason, the design aims to keep the UI simple and uncluttered with a clear navigation directly from the landing page to each of the three content pages.

There is a simple contact form that allows a user to leave a comment or to subscribe to a mailing list.

Icons allow users to quickly access the organization's social media pages (facebook only at present).

### User Stories
* As a visitor familiar with the project, I want to be able to easily get in touch with a comment or question.
* As a new visitor unfamiliar with the project I want to see a visually appealing introduction to the aims and activites undertaken and be able to easily join a mailing list or otherwise get in touch.
* As a local food enthusiast, I want to see information about the garden produce and see where this is sold locally.
* As a like-minded educator, I want to see some background information on the project and then easily get in touch with collaboration ideas using a contact form.
* As an older user or a user less-accustomed to online interation, I want to see an inviting and easy to navigate space that makes me feel at ease and is in line with my experience of the physical space.

* As a site-owner, I want to have an interenet presence that employs a look and feel in line with our aims, practices and goals. The site should mirror the atmosphere we endeavour to achieve in the physical location. 
* As a site-owner, I want site visitors to easily be able to get in touch with a question or comment, or to ask to be added to the mailing list.
* As a site-owner, I want any contact initiated on the website to go directly to my mail inbox. (nice to have, not a requirement for MS-1).

### Wireframe Mockups
Wireframe mockups are designed mobile-first. 
In initial designs, the landing/home page used a hamburger button in the top right as access to the site navigation. However, I have reconsidered this in light of the expected user/audience (in general an older demographic and perhaps less familiar with the conventions of internet navigation on mobile devices) and have instead chosen to implement individual and clearly visible buttons on the home page. In the future, as the site grows or pages are added, this approach may need to be expanded or superseded by a tidier option such as the hamburger button.

### Color Palette
The color palette used in the site aims to mirror the changing colours of the seasons in a garden and to be at the same time warm, vibrant and inviting. Ideas in relation to colour have been gleaned from general reading. Two useful resources have been [elementor](https://elementor.com/blog/color-theory-web-design/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwreT8BRDTARIsAJLI0KKeRi1NNrRWesVXyhOmyfNpwLFH8CCWWnFQ6Ael53UB6eYECiUufkAaAmKeEALw_wcB) and [coolors] (https://coolors.co/f94144-f3722c-f8961e-f9c74f-90be6d-43aa8b-577590).
As an initial guide, I will be using the palette described in the [draft color scheme](assets/color/Draft-color-scheme_An-Gairdin.pdf).
