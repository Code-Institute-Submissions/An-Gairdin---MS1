                  <p class="card-text">
                    Here at An Gáirdín we arrived at the stage where we no
                    longer felt at ease with our machines – lawn-mowers,
                    strimmers and hedge cutters. There are probably a few
                    factors which led to our decision to go petrol free in the
                    garden. Perhaps one reason is the same as that which led us
                    to using the ‘no-dig ‘method in the growing area – a
                    heightening awareness of our connection with the soil and of
                    sensitivity to the multiplicity of life there. Also the
                    noise of those machines somehow were an intrusion on the
                    energy and ambience of the place. Then there was, in our
                    case, the unnecessary use of fossil fuel. There is something
                    too about working with one’s hands as opposed to just
                    following a machine.
                  </p>

                  <p class="card-text">So what then?</p>

                  <p class="card-text">
                    The scythe and hedge clippers needed to be dusted down! But that
                    wasn’t enough, as we very quickly realised that we had
                    either never seen a scythe or never used one. Paul
                    Kingsnorth, who teaches scything, came to our aid. On our
                    course yesterday we had 10 eager participants from 10am –
                    3pm learning to assemble the parts, sharpen the blades and
                    ease into the rhythm. All were amazed with how quickly they
                    could mow the meadow with competence and confidence, a
                    tribute to Paul’s teaching skills.
